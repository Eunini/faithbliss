## Components Overview

### `OpenCageAutocomplete.tsx`
- Handles OpenCage Geocoding API integration
- Provides real-time location suggestions with 300ms debouncing
- Focuses on African cities and locations (47+ country codes)
- Gracefully handles API failures and network issues
- Smart request cancellation to prevent race conditions
- Rate-limited to respect OpenCage's 1 request/second limit

### `CountryCodeSelect.tsx`
- Comprehensive African country code dropdown

## Troubleshooting

### Location Autocomplete Not Working
1. **Check API Key**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENCAGE_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. **Check API Key Format**: Ensure no extra spaces or characters
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for network or API errors
4. **Check Daily Limits**: Verify you haven't exceeded 2,500 requests/day
5. **Check Internet**: OpenCage requires internet connection

### Country Dropdown Issues
- This component works offline and doesn't require any API keys
- If flags don't display, it's likely a font/emoji rendering issue

### Network Considerations
- OpenCage API requires internet connection
- Fallbacks are in place for offline usage
- Component gracefully degrades when API is unavailable
- 300ms debouncing prevents too many API calls
